## Out-of-Distribution Detection Scoring Metric

Given a test sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$, participant's model should give a continuous OoD score $t(\boldsymbol{x}_i)$ that increases monotonically with the confidence that their models predict a given sample as OoD.

The figure below illustrates that, by setting a threshold over the OoD score, samples with $t(\boldsymbol{x})$ above the threshold are classified as OoD, while those below are treated as InD. As the threshold varies, the predictions will lead to different true positive rates (TPRs, correctly identifying OoD samples) and false positive rates (FPRs, misclassifying InD samples as OoD). Tracing the pairs of FPR and TPR across all thresholds naturally defines the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The OoD score $t(\boldsymbol{x})$ could be, for example, any test statistic increasing monotonically with the OoD likelihood, or the $p$-value defined from the test statistics of the training data and test data.

In this competition, the model's OoD detection performance will be evaluated by the mean values of the ROC curve over $N=100$ logarithmically spaced FPRs between $0.001$ and $0.05$; that is,
    $$
        \text{Leaderboard score} \equiv \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N} \text{TPR}(\text{FPR}_i)  ~.
    $$
This metric is approximately proportional to the area under the ROC curve over the given FPR range in logarithmic scale. 

The FPR range $[0.001,0.05]$ is chosen to match the regime of practical interest for scientific anomaly detection, where the FPR corresponds to the Type-I error rate (significance level $\alpha$). The interval spans thresholds from weak evidence ($\alpha \sim 0.05$) to stringent detection ($\alpha \sim 0.001$, approximately $3\sigma$). Focusing on this range therefore rewards models with high detection power under practically meaningful false-positive constraints, while logarithmic spacing emphasizes performance at the smallest FPRs.
